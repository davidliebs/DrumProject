# DrumProject

DrumProject is a website that makes drumming on electric drumkits interactive through live-feedback on sheet music. Once the drumkit is connected to your computer, select the course you would like to learn and work your way up through the challenges. As you play along to the metronome, the music will light up depending on if you were correct, out of time or hit the wrong drum.
